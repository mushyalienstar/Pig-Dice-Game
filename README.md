# Pig-Dice-Game

# How do you Play Pig?
Each player starts with 0 points.

The first player rolls the die and scores as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die doesn't roll a 1.

The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end their turn by clicking the hold button.

If the player rolls a 1 their turn is over, they lose all points accumulated that turn, becoming the next player's turn.

Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.


# How do you Win?
The first player to accumulate 100 or more points wins the game.
